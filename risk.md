That time we don’t know how we can get our money back from them and the borrower will not agree to repay it, that would be a big once financial risk. Also, there is a main risk in traditional clothing business is investment risk, sometimes they would not be profitable. As we know that an investor who produces a lot of new traditional clothes sometimes, they would not be sold into market and investor will not able to resale it.

They can sell their product at very cheap cost as compare to another company with a lot of benefits. A company can drop the sale of another company and their products by giving a valuable discount to the customers and distract them very easily due to which you may face a huge risk to lose your business.

These types of risk can harm to the employees and can destroy our building and assets along with our informational data storage devices and computer systems. In traditional clothing industry everything is very costly to produce and if a fire sparking happens in the warehouse, any company have to face a big loss that can’t be fulfill forever.
